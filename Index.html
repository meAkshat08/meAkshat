    In my 1st year of B.Tech, I participated in a coding compition organized by IILM college and during the break of 1st and 2nd year I participated in a summer camp of coding organized by
    my college. In 2nd year I was selected in for an internship program in a company that works on AR/VR technology. Unfortunately due to some problems I had to back out from that. In 3rd
    year after 5th semester due to <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1">COVID-19</a> rest of my B.Tech was completed online. In final year i.e. 4th year me (with 3 other classmates) made a project that can sense the gas
    leak and
    can switch on the exhaust fan to eliminaste the gas from the area/room and can switch on the buzzer too to alert people.

    When I was in class 11th I took part in a Robotics Workshop in which we were taught about robots and how to make one. We made a robot that can move (on wheels) on a non-linear black
    strip. From 2014 to 2016 I was a part of my school's football and track and field team. In class 8th I took part in NASA Astronomy Olympiad. When I was in 1st class I participated in a
    group dance on the occasion of annual function.
